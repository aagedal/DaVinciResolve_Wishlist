# Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve Wishlist for 2025 and beyond
My wishlist for improvements to DaVinci Resolve after version 19 being released in 2024. The new version adds many great tools and improvements, but some things are still lacking. Some items here are just wishful thinking or ideas about what can be in the future.


## General
- [ ] Exporting a complete project template that can be installed with Double Clicking. Including: Project Settings, Fusion Templates, Export Templates, Subtitle Templates, Python Scripts, fonts.
- [ ] Syncing/Distributing complete project templates with Blackmagic Cloud. With public and private subscriptions to a template. Public useful for web community. Private for corporations.
- [ ] C2PA support! both import and export. Important for the future of photojournalism.
- [ ] Native support for stabilizing using Sony Alpha gyro data

## Export
- [ ] Export Current Frame as Still **with** embedded Color Space metadata
- [ ] Option to Export Current Frame as Still at souce resolution, while also retain original IPTC metadata of a source still.
- [ ] Being able to export JPEG XL.
- [ ] Being able to export TIFF, EXR, JPEG XL, PNG with embedded Color Space/Profile and gamma metadata. Especially useful for exporting HDR images.
- [ ] Being able to export animated AVIF.
- [ ] Being able to export AV1.

## Media Page
- [ ] Being able to see and edit IPTC and EXIF metadata of images


## Video Codecs
- [ ] VVC (not that high on my list this year, but maybe in a year or two)

## Audio Codecs
- [ ] Opus inside webm and mkv
- [ ] AAC on Linux

## Image Codecs
- [ ] Better RAW image file support for newer cameras
- [ ] Sony ARW files
- [ ] JPEG XL
- [ ] AVIF
- [ ] WebP
- [ ] HDR image formats in general. Both ISO HDR and Gain Map HDR.
- [ ] If editing images with IPTC metadata, main that metadata on export of individual clips/images.
- [ ] Better support for lossy DNG files.

## Editing
- [x] ~~Being able to quickly change the source audio track used in the inspector, if I only edited one of the source tracks into the timeline.~~ Added in Resolve 19.1
- [ ] New edit layout for vertical video: moving viewer to the right and spanning the entire height of the window. Either that or option to pop out a viewer as a separate window.
- [ ] ML Assisted Voice Editing? "Find some B-roll clip in my mediabin to hide the jumpcuts in this scene." or "I need this scene to be less than 2 minutes, can you cut it down for me?"

## Language
- [ ] Optional spelling and grammar correction on text fields: Metadata, and Text-tools.
- [ ] Better dialect support for non-english voice transcription.

## Fusion
- [ ] RayTracing in 3D scenes. (Now that M3 Macs and newer have HW RT).


## Other
- [ ] "DaVinci Resolve Photo Artist" a separate app for editing pictures / still images. Using the same tools as in Resolve, including Color Panels, but optimized for pictures, including managing metadata for photojournalist workflows. Including IPTC metadata in images on export.
